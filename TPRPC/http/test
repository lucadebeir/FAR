I have a FILE *, returned by a call to fopen(). I need to get a file descriptor from it, to make calls like fsync(fd) on it. What's the function to get a file descriptor from a file pointer?

    Or you could open the file with open(2), and you would have a file descriptor from the beginning – Antoine Pelisse Jun 29 '13 at 16:13

The proper function is int fileno(FILE *stream). It can be found in <stdio.h>, and is a POSIX standard but not standard C.

    Strictly speaking, there wouldn't be any need to mention any headers or libraries if the function was indeed a part of standard C library. However, it is not standard, which is why it might make sense to mention the header at least. – AnT Jul 2 '10 at 23:55

    Accessing functions in the standard C library does require including headers, at least if your compiler expects prototypes (I never remember what's actually standard behavior in that respect). Without headers, no names are defined at the beginning of a C file. – Novelocrat Jul 3 '10 at 0:20
    @Novelocrat: I didn't mean that there's no need to #include anything. I merely meant that it is always easy to find the name of the proper header for a standard function. I.e. it is not really critical to mention the exact header name in the answer. – AnT Jul 3 '10 at 1:51

    This is a good answer, but it is worth noting that this isn't a standard c function, it is a posix function. – Evan Teran Jul 3 '10 at 4:00

    It is not in the C standard, because file descriptors are a UNIX thing (on Linux, it is open(2), not open(3)). – not-a-user Oct 16 '14 at 9:08

Even if fileno(FILE *) may return a file descriptor, be VERY careful not to bypass stdio's buffer. If there is buffer data (either read or unflushed write), reads/writes from the file descriptor might give you unexpected results.

To answer one of the side questions, to convert a file descriptor to a FILE pointer, use fdopen(3)

    I don't believe this was helpful to people searching for this specifically, and this has already been answered in the comment section of OP's post a month before this was written. This is more of a logic clarification as opposed to real information. – kevr Feb 1 at 15:03
